         directory. There are 3 different ways to specify the paths, each of \
         them implies its own installation place in the target directory: \
         First way to install files is by giving a list of two elements: the \
         first being the destination basename (the name of the file in the \
         installation directory), and the second being the path to the file \
         itself. For example: $(b,[\"file.txt\" \"path/to/file\"]). The second \
         way is to include any file/directory under opam prefix. In this case, \
         variables like $(i,%{share}%) or $(i,%{lib}%) could be very usefull. \
         You should just give a list with one string that represents path \
         which prefix is the same with your current switch prefix. For \
         example, $(b,[\"/absolute-path-to-your-prefix/lib/odoc/odoc.cmi\"]) \
         or just $(b,[\"/%{odoc:lib}%/odoc.cmi\"]). Those files would be \
         installed in the directory \"opam\" at the root of installation \
         directory conserving entire path (it would be \
         $(b,INSTALLDIR/opam/lib/odoc/odoc.cmi) for previous example). The \
         last way to specify path is very similar with previous, but it takes \
         into account only external to opam files. The paths to thoses files \
         should be relative and implicit. For example, \
         $(b,[\"dir1/dir2/file.txt\"]). The file (or directory) will be \
         installed in \"external\" directory under the root of target \
         installation directory the same way as for opam files (it would be \
         $(b,INSTALLDIR/external/dir1/dir2/file.txt) for previous example)." );

         of two elements: the name and the value of the variable. Basenames \
         defined with $(b,embedded) field could be used as variables, to \
         reference absolute installed path. For example: $(b,embedded: [ \
         \"mydoc\" \"%{package:doc}%\"] envvar: [ \"DOC\" \"%{mydoc}%\"]) will \
         install directory referenced by $(i,package:doc) opam variable in \
