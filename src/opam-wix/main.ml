                              the target directory: \
                              First way to install files is by giving a list of two elements: the first being the destination \
                              basename (the name of the file in the installation directory), and the second being the \
                              path to the file itself. For example: $(b,[\"file.txt\" \"path/to/file\"]). \
                              The second way is to include any file/directory under opam prefix. In this case, variables like \
                              $(i,%{share}%) or $(i,%{lib}%) could be very usefull. You should just give a list with one string that \
                              represents path which prefix is the same with your current switch prefix. For example, \
                              $(b,[\"/absolute-path-to-your-prefix/lib/odoc/odoc.cmi\"]) or just $(b,[\"/%{odoc:lib}%/odoc.cmi\"]). \
                              Those files would be installed in the directory \"opam\" at the root of installation directory conserving \
                              entire path (it would be $(b,INSTALLDIR/opam/lib/odoc/odoc.cmi) for previous example). \
                              The last way to specify path is very similar with previous, but it takes into account only external to opam files. \
                              The paths to thoses files should be relative and implicit. For example, $(b,[\"dir1/dir2/file.txt\"]). \
                              The file (or directory) will be installed in \"external\" directory under the root of target installation directory \
                              the same way as for opam files (it would be $(b,INSTALLDIR/external/dir1/dir2/file.txt) for previous example).");

                            value of the variable. Basenames defined with $(b,embedded) field could be used as variables, to reference \
                            absolute installed path. For example: $(b,embedded: [ \"mydoc\" \"%{package:doc}%\"] envvar: [ \"DOC\" \"%{mydoc}%\"]) \
